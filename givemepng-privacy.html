      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        The GiveMePNG extension <strong>does not collect any personal data</strong>.
        All processing of images happens locally within your browser.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>External Services</h2>
      <p>
        The extension <strong>does not make any calls to external APIs or services</strong>.
        Your images are never sent to a server for processing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Metadata</h2>
      <p>
        By default, the extension <strong>strips all EXIF metadata</strong> from images during the
        conversion process. This helps prevent sharing sensitive information like GPS location
        or camera details.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can choose to preserve metadata via the extension's settings, but this is an
        opt‑in feature.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Storage</h2>
      <p>
        The extension uses <code>chrome.storage</code> to save your settings and the conversion
        counter. This data is stored locally in your browser and is not transmitted elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        The extension also includes a conservative, built-in blocklist of certain sensitive
        domains (for example, some banking, government, identity, and security-related sites).
        On these sites, GiveMePNG disables its hover-based image tools as an extra safety
        measure. This blocklist is implemented locally and does not involve any external lookups.
      </p>

      <h2>Future Features (Transparency)</h2>
      <p>
        We may introduce optional features later such as a global, anonymous conversion counter
        for social proof. If we do:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It will be strictly opt‑in and disabled by default</li>
        <li>Only aggregate counts will be transmitted (no image data, no identifiers)</li>
        <li>The endpoint domain will be explicitly listed in permissions</li>
        <li>The privacy policy and store listing will be updated</li>
      </ul>
